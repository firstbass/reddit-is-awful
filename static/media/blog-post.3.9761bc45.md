## **Media and You**

Every day we spend more than 8 hours exposed to different forms of media, it keeps us well informed, entertained and opinionated. Media influences us through news headlines, information we see online, on tv, and what we hear through the radio, it creeps into our daily lives and starts to lean into us subconsciously through magazines and advertisements that creates and recreates the standard of success, beauty, and living. In movies we are exposed to violence, fantasy, and crocked ideas about love. Even the music that enters our ear is a part of medias influence, every day our brain processes all these sorts of information through a variety of sources, sometimes we don't even wonder the validity of the information we received and then we also believe and react to it right away.

## **Why should we care about media bias?**

Spreading truth and fighting falsehood in social networks helps us guard our democracy by improving the accuracy of how we read, and how we share our views online or in person. In order to do so we must start with the fundamental question about the human phycology and that is how we decide what news, forums, movies, and magazines are true and what should we believe in. There is a very straight forward answer for that, which is, humans, start giving credence to something that goes along their ideology, this results in aligning potentially false ideologies with our own and discrediting the true ones.

## **What little steps can we take to stop fake news?**

One way we can guard and filter ourselves from the information provided by the media is by sparing a lot of assumptions by simply, verifying information, the answer to that is being media literate being near it simply, by taking a step further, digging a little deeper, considering a little longer, and by thinking a little harder about the information you get from the media.



## **Personal Bias In Social Media** **(Reddit as an example)**

There's always been fake news, rumors, hoaxes, and propaganda but now, the world runs faster than ever, and communication is easier than ever. Anyone with a smartphone and Twitter account or a Reddit account can shout their message to the world. But, how does misinformation spread and how do you find and act against false information as it goes berserk throughout our social network? . To understand this phenomenon, lets talk about Reddit and what is it actually.


## **Something for everyone**

Tech geeks have their technology, flag geeks have their vexillology and on the off chance you are interested in something that doesn't yet exist, just press a button and a new subreddit is born. Each subreddit works just like the main page, a constantly updating list of interesting stuff, according to the people interested in that stuff. When a subreddit grows large, it can be terrifyingly good at this.

For example: &quot;AWW&quot; a section is devoted to adorableness, it is a global 24-hour a day battle to find the cutest images ever. Turns out if you give people with baby animal photos, a place to have their baby animal photos compete, the result is the highest density of cuteness human civilization has yet created, seriously just check it out yourself.

But without editors running the site, how does that sorting process work? , links people submit are balloons floating up and down the list. When someone votes up a link it adds a bit of helium and down votes sucks out little bit of helium. Periodically, reddit puts weights on all the balloons, giving newer links that show up later a chance to compete against the ones that have been around longer.

## **Bias in play?**

This method is shockingly good at sorting stuff, be it international politics or pictures of computer setups. Of course, when a website covers the whole of human endeavor, things gets weird like subreddits for only photos of birds with arms or only photos of Hitler with socks and sometimes there can be some horrifying stuff as well, that cannot be unseen but remember that reddit can be weird not because reddit is weird but because humans are weird. One great (or worse) thing about reddit is that it changes to suite you, as you join subreddits you like and leave those you don't the main page becomes &quot;yours&quot;, listing all the best stuff from all the subreddits you follow and leaving out stuff from the ones you don't. The result of this is that we see more biased information that is Infront of us when using reddit.

## **How to find unbiased News Sources?**

One of the best results to come from the widespread use of the internet, is the ease of access for finding breaking news. Not since television news begin airing, have we seen such a massive step in advancing how easy it is for anyone to find out what's happening in their community and in the worth at large. Of course, with that ease of access also comes the unfortunate spread of misinformation. If you are trying to find excellent news sources to keep up with currents events along with a healthy amount of commentary from across the pollical spectrum, then here are some ways we can combat these issues.

To find unbiased news sources, first thing to do is to separate news stories from editorialization. Most major publications, both locally and on a national or global scale have the branches of their companies dedicated to both, reporting hard news and writing opinion pieces based around that current news. Almost newspaper sources mark their opinion pieces as such and most of these newspapers can typically lean to one side of the aisle in their editorial pieces the Washington Post for example has a left leaning editorial board while the  Wall Street Journal's editorial board is mostly made up of conservative thinkers, both of these sources however typically offers straightforward news stories without massive editorialization from the author. Once you move away from classic news sources however things grow more complicated and in our vast media landscape most modern news publications have mixed editorialization with news in a way that can make it harder than ever to find the fabled unbiased news reporting. From cable news to new media publications it's harder than ever to find content that doesn't have some sort of slant, sources like Vox, CNN, MSNBC, and crooked media all offer news reporting from mostly liberal thinking authors, meanwhile sources like Fox News, The Daily Caller and The Federalist all report through a conservative lens.

## Keeping Yourself True

That doesn't mean you cant consume media from a source that reflects your views at its core, bias is not inherently bad, as long as you know its there and one of the best ways to consume ideas is to listen to a variety of viewpoints on a topic, so long, as you have a core base effects to work off. That's fact-checking sites like politifact.com, factcheck.org, and snopes.com are important to ensure that you know what's true and false when diving into the world of reporting online. These sites are typically well sources making it easy to check their facts yourself, if you are looking to ensure they're telling the truth.

Finally, if you do wish to consume news without an ounce of bias slant or editorialization, those sources do still exist, even in a polarized world. Sources like C-Span the Financial Times and Foreign Policy tend minimize their bias making them easy recommends. Of course, they are far from the only sources online to provide unbiased news. We found that the site &quot;_Media Bias/Fact Check_&quot; supplies readers with excellent roundups of the best sites for both unbiased news and sources from the left, and right. &quot;Media Bias/Fact Check&quot; also provides readers with a list of satire sites like The Onion and questionable sources including Breitbart, The Daily Stormer and The Democratic Moms, all of which have been known to peddle false or misleading news in the past.
