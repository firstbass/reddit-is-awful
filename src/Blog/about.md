## **For Students**

Welcome to **Reddit is Awful**! Fed up of seeing fake news everywhere? We are too! Join us as we go over how to make sense of the media landscape with one very relatable topic: Reddit! Love it or hate it, this is the time to articulate that! 

If you aren't quite sure what bias in media or media literacy are, don't worry, we have some pages explaining that for you! Once you've got a good context of why you're reading here, the "Navigating Reddit" page is our main attraction. We go over what Reddit is, how it's biased, and conclude with a checklist you can go through before you browse the site. If none of that tickles your fancy, we have an extra page going in depth over the inner machinations behind the social media you use, from YouTube's notorious algorithm to social media influencer's reach on what kind of content you're suggested in your feeds. 

What are you waiting for? Get started now!

## **For Teachers**

Thank you for your interest. This was made by students, for students, to explore bias in the media in a novel way: exploring a social medium pertinent to many students lives. Nearly every student will have an opinion on Reddit, and you may be surprised to hear: 7 out of every 10 users of Reddit use the site as a news medium!

Obviously, there needs to be a conversation around this issue - Reddit has a strong selection bias towards populist, and provocative headlines. Despite this, we chose Reddit for a very apt reason: *Reddit lets the users partake in its selection algorithm*. This means that, ideally, we should be able to promote a more well balanced social media environment just through educating our students! Still, even if ideals don't pan through - as they are wont to do - the students will still get something out of this experience. We have a wide array of topics beyond just Reddit - media bias, media literacy, and even a discussion on data algorithms! 

Above all else, we hope you can use the information here as a launchpad of sorts - at the end of the day, we want discussions to happen around the media we consume. Whatever your discipline, you can surely link this back to your subject: bring up a data mining algorithm, or link this back to journalistic standards, or even discuss the social contexts of reddit as an art platform... whatever your heart desires. Let's work together to promote a front page of the internet that's full of critical readers... and commenters!
